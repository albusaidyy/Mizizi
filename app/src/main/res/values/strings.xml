    <!-- Diseases, symptoms and Treatment -->

    <string name="apple_apple_scab">Symptoms:\nThe fungal disease forms pale yellow or olive-green spots on the upper surface of leaves. Dark, velvety spots may appear on the lower surface. Severely infected leaves become twisted and puckered and may drop early. Infected fruit becomes distorted and may crack allowing entry of secondary organisms. Severely affected fruit may drop, especially when young.\n\n<b>Treatment:\n</b>Choose resistant varieties when possible. Rake under trees and destroy infected leaves to reduce the number of fungal spores available to start the disease cycle over again next spring. Water in the evening or early morning hours (avoid overhead irrigation) to give the leaves time to dry out before infection can occur. Spread a 3- to 6-inch layer of compost under trees, keeping it away from the trunk, to cover soil and prevent splash dispersal of the fungal spores. For best control, spray liquid copper soap early, two weeks before symptoms normally appear. Alternatively, begin applications when disease first appears, and repeat at 7 to 10 day intervals up to blossom drop. Bonide® Sulfur Plant Fungicide, a finely ground wettable powder, is used in pre-blossom applications and must go on before rainy or spore discharge periods. Apply from pre-pink through cover (2 Tbsp/ gallon of water), or use in cover sprays up to the day of harvest. Organocide Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Apply as a soil drench or foliar spray (3-4 tsp/ gallon of water) to prevent and attack fungal problems. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.</string>

    <string name="apple_black_rot">Black rot is a disease of apples that infects fruit, leaves and bark caused by the fungus Botryosphaeria obtuse. \n\nSymptoms:\nEarly symptoms are often limited to leaf symptoms such as purple spots on upper leaf surfaces. As these spots age, the margins remain purple, but the centers dry out and turn yellow to brown. Over time, the spots expand and heavily infected leaves drop from the tree. Infected branches or limbs will show characteristic red-brown sunken areas that expand each year. When fruits are tiny and green, you’ll notice red flecks or purplish pimples that enlarge as the fruit grow. Mature fruit lesions take on a bulls-eye appearance, with bands of brown and black areas expanding outward from a central point in each lesion. Commonly, black rot disease causes blossom end rot or mummification of the fruits on the tree.\n\nTreatment:\nTreating black rot on apple trees starts with sanitation. Fungal spores fall on fallen leaves, mummified fruits, dead bark and cankers, it’s important to keep all the fallen debris and dead fruit cleaned up and away from the tree. Check for red cankers and remove them by cutting them out or pruning away the affected limbs at least six inches beyond the wound. Destroy all infected tissue immediately and keep a watchful eye out for new signs of infection. Remove any injured or insect-invaded fruits to avoid re-infection. Use general purpose fungicides, like copper-based sprays and lime sulfur.</string>

    <string name="apple_cedar_apple_rust">Symptoms:\nOn apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. These gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. Orange spots may develop on the fruit as well. Heavily infected leaves may drop prematurely.\n\nTreatment:\nChoose resistant cultivars when available. Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees. Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely. Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary. On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.\nContact your local Agricultural Extension office for other possible solutions in your area.</string>

    <string name="cherry_including_sour_powdery_mildew">Symptoms:\nLight colored circular lesions on leaves inside tree canopy which develop a powdery appearance; lesions may coalesce to cover leaf; if infection is severe, leaves may blister and infected shoots may be distorted and stunted; infected fruits may have slightly depressed areas on the surface containing fungal hyphae (filamentous fungal structures).\n\nTreatment:\nPlanting trees in a sunny area, pruning to allow good air circulation and using slow-release fertilizers can help discourage powdery mildew. However, in cases where powdery mildew already exists, many home gardeners turn to fungicides to assist with control. Neem oil is a plant-based insecticide that also works as a fungicide and has the advantage of being less toxic for backyard use. However, it can injure leaves when applied in temperatures over 90 degrees or when plants are drought-stressed, as is often the case in the Sacramento area. Oil sprays deposited on foliage and stems can block the air openings of plants. This may result in leaf burn, darkened bark and dead twigs and branches.</string>

    <string name="corn_maize_cercospora_leaf_spot_gray_leaf_spot">Symptoms:\nMature foliar lesions symptomatic of gray leaf spot are gray to tan in color, long (3/4 to 2 1/2 inches), narrow (1/8 to 1/4 inch), rectangular, and run parallel to the leaf veins. Under heavy disease pressure these lesions may coalesce and blight the entire leaf. Early symptoms of infection include pinpoint lesions surrounded by yellow haloes that can be seen by holding an affected leaf up to light. Generally within two weeks or so these pinpoint lesions elongate and develop into their distinctive rectangular shape. With severe blighting of leaves and leaf sheaths in heavily infested fields, stalk deterioration and severe lodging may occur</string>

    <string name="corn_maize_common_rust">Symptoms:\nDevelopment of dark, reddish-brown pustules (uredinia) scattered over both the upper and lower surfaces of the corn leaves. These pustules may appear on any above ground part of the plant, but are most abundant on the leaves. Pustules appear oval to elongate in shape, are generally small, less than 1/4 inch long, and are surrounded by the leaf epidermal layer, where it has broken through. If infections occur while the leaves are still in the whorl, these pustules may develop in bands across the surface as the leaf expands in size.\n\nControl:\nEarly fungicide application may be necessary for effective disease control.</string>

    <string name="corn_maize_northern_leaf_blight">Symptoms:\nThe most common diagnostic symptom of the disease on corn is cigar-shaped or elliptical necrotic gray-green lesions on the leaves that range from one to seven inches long. These lesions may first appear as narrow, tan streaks that run parallel to the leaf veins. Fully developed lesions typically have a sooty appearance during humid weather, as a result of spore (conidia) formation. As the disease progresses, the lesions grow together and create large areas of dead leaf tissue. The lesions found in Northern corn leaf blight are more acute if the leaves above the ear are infected during or soon after flowering of the plant. In susceptible corn hybrids, lesions are also found on the husk of ears or leaf sheaths. In partially resistant hybrids, these lesions tend to be smaller due to reduced spore formation. In highly resistant hybrids, the only visible disease symptoms may be minute yellow spots.\n\nManagement\nManagement of NCLB can be achieved primarily by using hybrids with resistance, but because resistance may not be complete or may fail, it is advantageous to utilize an integrated approach with different cropping practices and fungicides. Scouting fields and monitoring local conditions is vital to control this disease. The use of foliar fungicides for corn have also been shown to control NCLB</string>

    <string name="grape_black_rot">Symptoms and Diagnosis:\nLeaves:\n\nReddish brown and circular to angular spots appear on the upper surface of the leaves starting in late spring. As spots merge, they form irregular, reddish brown blotches. The number of spots or lesions per leaf varies from 2 to more than 100 depending on the severity of the disease. The center of the leaf spot turns tannish brown and is surrounded by a black margin. Black, speck-sized fruiting bodies (pycnidia) are arranged in a definite ring just inside the margin of the lesion. Only young, rapidly growing leaves are affected.\nFruit:\n\n Shortly after the flower petals fall, fruit infection can occur. Most infections start when the fruit is half to almost full size. A small spot will appear that becomes circular and whitish tan, often surrounded by a brown ring. This happens while the berry is still green. The spots grow rapidly and may cover half of the berry within 48 hours. Within a few days the entire berry becomes coal black, hard, and mummified. The surface of the withered fruit is soon covered with minute, black, pimple-like, spore producing pycnidia that are arranged in circular zones.\n\nControl:\nFungicides. Use protective fungicide sprays. Pesticides registered to protect the developing new growth include copper, captan, ferbam, mancozeb, maneb, triadimefon, and ziram. Important spraying times are as new shoots are 2 to 4 inches long, and again when they are 10 to 15 inches long, just before bloom, just after bloom, and when the fruit has set.</string>

    <string name="grape_esca_black_measles">Disease symptoms\nThe disease attacks the leaves, stem, flowers and berries. All the new growth on the vine is prone to attack during the growing season. The symptoms are in the form of irregularly shaped reddish brown spots on the leaves and a black scab on berries. Occasionally, small elliptical dark-colored canker lesions occur on the young stems and tendrils. Leaf, cane and tendril infection can occur only when the tissue is young, but berries can be infected until almost fully-grown if an active fungicide residue is not present. The affected berries shrivel and become hard black mummies.\n\nControl:\nFungicides. Use protective fungicide sprays. Pesticides registered to protect the developing new growth include copper, captan, ferbam, mancozeb, maneb, triadimefon, and ziram. Important spraying times are as new shoots are 2 to 4 inches long, and again when they are 10 to 15 inches long, just before bloom, just after bloom, and when the fruit has set.</string>

    <string name="grape_leaf_blight_isariopsis_leaf_spot">Disease symptoms:\nRoots show black, sunken, necrotic lesions. In cross section, the base of the trunk appears necrotic and xylem vessels may be black in color. Leaves may appear to be water stressed or scorched, and vines may be stunted and/or killed. Cylindrocarpon may occur in combination with other plant pathogens.\n\nControl Measures:\nFungicides. Use protective fungicide sprays. Pesticides registered to protect the developing new growth include copper, captan, ferbam, mancozeb, maneb, triadimefon, and ziram. Important spraying times are as new shoots are 2 to 4 inches long, and again when they are 10 to 15 inches long, just before bloom, just after bloom, and when the fruit has set.</string>

    <string name="orange_haunglongbing_citrus_greening">Symptoms:\nHLB is distinguished by the common symptoms of yellowing of the veins and adjacent tissues; followed by splotchy mottling of the entire leaf, premature defoliation, dieback of twigs, decay of feeder rootlets and lateral roots, and decline in vigor, ultimately followed by the death of the entire plant. Affected trees have stunted growth, bear multiple off-season flowers (most of which fall off), and produce small, irregularly shaped fruit with a thick, pale peel that remains green at the bottom and tastes very bitter.\n\nControl Measures:\nCertain antibiotics, specifically streptomycin and oxytetracycline, may be effective in the fight against citrus greening disease and have been used in the United States but have been banned in Brazil and the European Union. The EPA allowed use of streptomycin and oxytetracyclin on orchards with citrus fruits like grapefruits, oranges and tangerines in Florida on an emergency basis.</string>

    <string name="peach_bacterial_spot">Symptoms\nFruit symptoms include pitting, cracking, gumming, and watersoaked tissue, which can make the fruit more susceptible to brown rot, rhizopus, and other fungal infections. Severe leaf spot infections can cause early defoliation.\n\nTreatment\nBiscoe, Blazing Star, Candor, Contender, Harrow Beauty, Harrow Diamond, PF1, PF12A, PF24–007, PF27A, Starfire</string>

    <string name="pepper_bell_bacterial_spot">Symptoms:\nLeaf spots that appear on the lower surface of older leaves as small, pimples and on the upper leaf surface as small water–soaked spots are a symptom of bacterial spot. This is an important pepper disease in Maryland. It also occasionally attacks tomatoes. Eventually, the spots develop gray to tan centers with darker borders. Lesions enlarge during warm, humid weather. Leaves may then turn yellow, then brown and drop. Lesions may also develop on stems. Fruits develop small, raised rough spots that do not affect eating quality. Severely infected leaves will drop resulting in sunscald of peppers. Bacterial leaf spot is spread by splashing rain and working with wet, infected plants. This disease can defoliate plants during wet weather.\n\nManagement\nYou can minimize problems with bacterial spot by following these tips:\nSelect resistant varieties. Purchase disease–free seed and transplants. Treat seeds by soaking them for 2 minutes in a 10% chlorine bleach solution (1 part bleach; 9 parts water). Thoroughly rinse seeds and dry them before planting. Mulch plants deeply with a thick organic material like newspaper covered with straw or grass clippings. Avoid overhead watering. Remove and discard badly infected plant parts and all debris at the end of the season. Spray every 10–14 days with fixed copper (organic fungicide) to slow down the spread of infection. Rotate peppers to a different location if infections are severe and cover the soil with black plastic mulch or black landscape fabric prior to planting.</string>

    <string name="potato_early_blight">Symptoms:\nSymptoms of early blight occur on fruit, stem and foliage of tomatoes and stem, foliage and tubers of potatoes.  Initial symptoms on leaves appear as small 1–2 mm black or brown lesions and under conducive environmental conditions the lesions will enlarge and are often surrounded by a yellow halo . Lesions greater than 10 mm in diameter often have dark pigmented concentric rings.  This so-called bullseye type lesion is highly characteristic of early blight. As lesions expand and new lesions develop entire leaves may turn chlorotic and dehisce, leading to significant defoliation.  Lesions occurring on stems are often sunken and lens-shaped with a light center, and have the typical concentric rings. On young tomato seedlings lesions may completely girdle the stem, a phase of the disease known as collar rot, which may lead to reduced plant vigor or death.\n\nTreatment:\nThe so-called Quinone outside Inhibitors (QoI) class of fungicides (FRAC code #11) which inhibit fungal respiration are highly active against Alternaria species. Molecules from this very important class of fungicides which are registered for Alternaria control in potato and or tomato include azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin, fenamidone and famoxidone.  In general QoIs are readily taken up into the plant tissue and work preventively to stop infection by inhibiting spore germination. They are weakly curative and use rates are considerably lower than the traditional protectant products, although cost per acre is typically higher. QoIs are high-risk fungicides with respect to resistance development, and isolates of A. solani which possess the F129L mutation have been isolated from the field.</string>

    <string name="potato_late_blight">Symptoms\nLeaves\n\nPale green water soaked spots (2–10 mm) appear mostly on the margin and tips. In moist weather, spots may appear anywhere on the leaves, enlarge rapidly and turn necrotic and black killing the entire leaf instantly. On the corresponding lower side, whitish cottony growth containing millions of sporangia forms around the dead area in a ring pattern\nStem and petiole\n\nLight brown lesions develop which elongates and encircles the stem and petioles breaking them and killing the plant/leaves instantly.\n\nControl\nFungicides with protectant and curative properties are registered for use against early blight on tomato and potato. The cheaper protectant fungicides such as mancozeb and chlorothalonil are the foundation of most early blight management programs. These fungicides must be reapplied every 7-10 days to provide protection of new growth as well as to counter the effects of weathering which progressively removes the chemical from the leaf surface. Advantages of these types of products include their reliable efficacy and multi-site mode of action, which reduces the risk of resistant isolates developing in the pathogen population; therefore, they are useful as tank mix partners or used in rotation with other fungicides. Disadvantages include the need to apply regularly and their relatively high use rates.</string>

    <string name="strawberry_leaf_scorch">Symptoms:\nScorched strawberry leaves are caused by a fungal infection which affects the foliage of strawberry plantings. The fungus responsible is called Diplocarpon earliana. Strawberries with leaf scorch may first show signs of issue with the development of small purplish blemishes that occur on the topside of leaves. Over time, the spots will continue to grow larger and darken. In severe cases, dark spots may even cover entire portions of strawberry plant leaves and cause them to completely dry and fall from the plant. Though the foliage of the infected plants is not aesthetically pleasing, it is seldom that the presence of this fungus impacts the quality of the strawberry crop itself.\n\nControl:\nSince this fungal pathogen over winters on the fallen leaves of infect plants, proper garden sanitation is key. This includes the removal of infected garden debris from the strawberry patch, as well as the frequent establishment of new strawberry transplants. The creation of new plantings and strawberry patches is key to maintaining a consistent strawberry harvest, as older plants are more likely to show signs of severe infection. When making new plantings, always ensure that good planting practices are implemented. These practices include the use of proper plant spacing to provide adequate air circulation, and the use of drip irrigation. The avoidance of waterlogged soil and frequent garden cleanup will help to reduce the likelihood of spread of this fungus.</string>

    <string name="tomato_bacterial_spot">Symptoms:\nThis disease is a result of the bacteria xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, which can exist on tomato seeds as well as on specific weeds. Bacterial spot can be spread through rain, irrigation, or wet plants. Tomato plants can be infected through pores and wounds, especially in warm, moist weather.\n\nRemedies\nBuy certified disease-free tomato seeds and use sterilized soil or a mix that is commercially rendered. Submerge seeds for one minute in 1.3% sodium hypochlorite. Submerge the seeds in 122-degree Fahrenheit water for 25 minutes. Ensure that the tomato plants do not receive too much water, as moist conditions attract the spot-causing bacteria. Copper fungicides for tomatoes will deny the growth of bacterial spot for two to four weeks. Copper sprays are best applied before any signs of disease are present, since this will enable them to better control it. These types of sprays should be used before and after rain, but not during. If spots are discovered, spray plants for 7 to 10 days, and for one day before transplanting them. Once in the field, spotted plants should be sprayed one week after being planted, every 5 to 7 days when the weather is rainy, and every 10 days when the weather is drier.</string>

    <string name="tomato_leaf_mold">Symptoms:\nWith this type of fungus, it is rare that the fruit is infected as well. The signs to look for are all on the leaves. The tops will begin to develop small, white, gray, yellow, or pale green patches. The underside of the leave will have a fuzzy feeling that is purple in color. Sometimes the fuzz will be olive green. The “fuzz” is actually spores of the fungus.\n\nRemedies:\nWith this type of fungus, it is rare that the fruit is infected as well. The signs to look for are all on the leaves.

    <string name="tomato_septoria_leaf_spot">Symptoms:\nSeptoria leaf spot is caused by septoria lycopersici, a fungus that lives in the soil near tomato plants or on weeds that can grow in gardens. The fungus creates spores that are carried by wind and rain to uninfected plants. The fungus causes deterioration of the plant foliage.\n\nRemedies:\nSeptoria leaf spot is caused by septoria lycopersici, a fungus that lives in the soil near tomato plants or on weeds that can grow in gardens.

    <string name="tomato_spider_mites_two_spotted_spider_mite">Symptoms:\nTwo-spotted spider mites are occasional pests that can cause serious damage to some vegetable crops during hot dry weather. Mites can injure tomatoes, beans, muskmelons, watermelons, and sweet corn. Extended periods of hot, dry weather favors mite buildups. Infestations usually first occur at the edge of a field, typically near rank weed growth or dirt roads\n\nRemedies:\nNatural enemies of mites are present in and around fields and can keep mite populations low. Many insecticides used for control of insect pests severely reduce numbers of beneficial insects that keep mite populations in check. Therefore, apply insecticides only as-needed, rather than at regularly scheduled intervals. When possible, select pesticides that will have the least impact on beneficial insects. Destruction of weeds adjacent to and in fields should be done in the fall or early spring. Growers should manage weeds around fields carefully during the season. Grass should be mowed regularly. Spraying or mowing of weeds after growth has become rank may increase the movement of mites to cultivated plants. Use of overhead-sprinkler irrigation may provide some short- term relief of mite infestations. Miticides are available for some vegetable crops but should be used only where justified. As with aphids, mark infestations with flags, and check them again every 3 or 4 days. Mites can easily be moved to infested plants on clothing, so always examine infested areas last during inspections. If the infestation is not spreading, treatment will not be required. Because mite populations often are localized, spot spraying may be effective. If you spray only a portion of the field, spray a buffer zone of 100 to 200 feet beyond the mite-infested area. Resistance to pesticides has increased the difficulty of controlling these pests. Because mites primarily occur on the undersides of leaves, applications of contact miticides need to be directed at both the lower and upper leaf surfaces. Mite eggs are resistant to some miticides, so repeated applications are often necessary to control infestations. Two applications spaced 5 to 7 days apart may be necessary.</string>

    <string name="tomato_target_spot">Symptoms:\nSymptoms appear on all above ground parts of the plant. Foliar lesions begin as small, pinpoint, water-soaked spots on the upper surface. Gradually these increase in size (up to 2 cm diameter), becoming circular, frequently ringed, and pale brown with conspicuous yellow halos. The lesions will coalesce leading to blighting of foliage. The subsequent premature defoliation affects fruit quality and yield.\n\nRemedies:\nSpray with protectant fungicides after first symptoms appear. Consult with your local extension agent for fungicides available in your region. Remove affected debris to prevent carryover into the next crop. Use an adequate period of crop rotation. Genetic resistance to this fungus has been documented in tomato and soybean but commercial varieties are not yet available.</string>


    <string name="tomato_yellow_leaf_curl_virus">Symptoms:\nSpray with protectant fungicides after first symptoms appear. Consult with your local extension agent for fungicides available in your region. Remove affected debris to prevent carryover into the next crop. Use an adequate period of crop rotation. Genetic resistance to this fungus has been documented in tomato and soybean but commercial varieties are not yet available.\n\nRemedies:\nCurrently, the most effective treatments used to control the spread of TYLCV are insecticides and resistant crop varieties. The effectiveness of insecticides is not optimal in tropical areas due to whitefly resistance against the insecticides; therefore, insecticides should be alternated or mixed to provide the most effective treatment against virus transmission.[6] Developing countries experience the most significant losses due to TYLCV infections due to the warm climate as well as the expensive costs of insecticides used as the control strategy. Other methods to control the spread of TYLCV include planting resistant/tolerant lines, crop rotation, and breeding for resistance of TYLCV. As with many other plant viruses, one of the most promising methods to control TYLCV is the production of transgenic tomato plants resistant to TYLCV.</string>

    <string name="tomato_mosaic_virus">Symptoms:\nTomato mosaic virus symptoms can be found at any stage of growth and all parts of the plant may be infected. ToMV causes yellow mosaic symptoms on the leaves and tomato fruits. Tomato mosaic virus symptoms are seen as a general mottling or mosaic appearance on foliage. Light and darker green mosaic leaf mottle, sometimes with distortion of younger leaves; this is the most common reaction in summer in glasshouses.\n\nRemedies:\nThe only treatment is prevention. No chemical products are available to cure or protect plants. The best factor in controlling and reducing infection is to practice sanitation. Remove any infected plants, including the roots. Remove Also, discard any plants near those affected.</string>
